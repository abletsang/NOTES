Competition is not good--in the long run, everybody is undifferentiated and you don’t make money. There is no space to think about treating workers well, or thinking long term when you are cutting costs just to survive today
Monopolies are good, if they are creative monopolies--here there is long term growth, value added from innovation to the world, and there are profits, which is extra incentive to keep creating and thinking long term
Competition in general is destructive, better to avoid directly
 
Definite and indefinite optimism: here in north america we are indefinitely optimistic… think things will get better, but don’t do anything to make things better ← insanity!!
Company culture is important--get the foundation wrong, you will fail
The CEO should be paid the least, and everyone should want to work together--it is insanity to work somewhere for so many hours if you don’t want to be around those people
Exponential growth: in venture funds, usually it is just one that does better than everything else in the portfolio combined. Don’t keep your eggs in one basket is not necessarily true, if you consider that fact
Sales is often hidden, and these people are given unrelated sounding names, because no one wants to reminded that they’re being sold
Anyone who says a product sells itself is delusional (lying to himself), or is trying to sell something
Think of distribution as part of the design of your product
Superior sales and distribution can create a monopoly by itself, even without product differentiation
Effective distribution: customer lifetime value (CLV) > customer acquisition cost (CAC)
 
Complex sales: avg sale is 7 figures. Salesman is CEO--at deals like that, they need to talk to the CEO
Personal sales: couple to several thousand dollar each sales, need modest sized sales team to move to wide enough audience
Dead zone: between complex and personal, sales amounts not high enough to have a team, but people you need to reach require sales people. Here distribution creates bottleneck
Marketing and ads work for relatively low priced products with mass appeal but lack method of viral distribution
Don’t try too hard with advertising budgets and competing with existing companies, it’s not a good competition
 
Am i taking up a large piece of a small market? Is that market actually the market or is it bigger?
What will the industry look like in 10-20 years, and how will i fit in?
