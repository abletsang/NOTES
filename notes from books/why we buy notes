- Butt brush effect: shoppers don’t like being touched and brushed from behind, and will move away from merchandise they’re interested in to avoid it
- Get to know the most popular pathways, by demographic. It will tell you where to place things to lure in certain people and signage
- cash/wrap area is very important part. If it looks unclear/long/chaotic, people will leave, even if they’ve just spent time getting everything they wanted
- having to wait in general, impressions plunge FAST
- sales data shows victories, but not losses. Hence not a good diagnostic tool
- if we only went into to stores when we needed something and got what we needed, the economy would go bust!
- the more time spent in the store, the more a customer buys. The more comfortable and enjoyable the experience, the longer a customer will stay
- conversion rate: measures how well a store is functioning
- marketing, ads, promo, location bring in shoppers, up to merchandise and employees and store to convert
    - this number is not used enough
- also need to take into account who is walking in (ex. Family of 4 will not all leave with TVs)
- confusion index: flip side to getting people to stay longer, eliminating customer time spent lost wandering
- it will always feel like they’ve been there longer than they have
- interception rate: % of customers with employee interaction. The more, the greater the average sale
- customers value privacy, and upon initial entry will resent too much from the staff, but will also hate not being acknowledged
- who shops at your store, and who is buying what?
    - ex. Family restaurants with not enough 4 seat tables and unused counter space
    - ex. Dog treats are purchased mostly by kids and seniors. Dont place so high
    - ex. Cosmetic counters need privacy for the women looking
- stores that cater to diff age groups… age groups sometimes want nothing to do with each other
    - ex. Aspirin near the soda. All the teens walking by made the seniors felt frazzled
- ex. Hair dye. Older women are doing routine dyes to cover grey, place near main area. Younger people are not doing these dyes and are more novel so like to look longer, place further in private areas
- consider flow: a bookstore placed deals near the door, bringing in more people and sales, but they wouldn’t bother to look through the rest of the store after
 
DESIGNING FOR HUMANS
- parts of being human
    - hands at rest are approx 3 feet from ground, 2 hands only, mostly right handed
    - eyes see directly in front, peripheral vision influenced by environment
    - rather look at people than objects
- can anticipate how and where people walk, including speed, what they will think and look at
- people always walk in parking lots. Displays to the parking lots are often too small to see at a distance (with speed our peripheral vision is smaller) and once we are close enough we just want to be inside. Wasted
- lighting usually isn’t changed, so visibility is often low either at night or in the day
- once in, there is a landing strip to adjust to being inside. Usually everyone slows at exactly the same place
- anything placed before that will be missed, so you should either only place things past that zone, or aim to make that zone smaller (creaky door, change in floor/lighting, big displays that act like speed bumps, big discount sign to grab attention), or consider pushing the store out the door
    - revolving doors and auto doors don’t help
- only things people see on a door are push/pull, or the hours if the place is closed.
- people who are greeted are less likely to steal
- being the first to be seen isn’t necessarily good--sometimes you need some time to anticipate, or feel ready. Many best products are placed in middle, and at trade shows, booths near the entrance are the worst
- on a cold day: as a woman, holding handbag and coat, means i only have 1 hand. Grab one thing and i have 0 hands!
- design space to help this situation. Ex. counters for putting things down while paying.
- ex. Making sure people are using shopping aids. This means putting shopping aids around the store (people often don’t grab from the front because they don’t think they’ll be buying much, most don’t consider seriously until after some browsing) and getting employees to hand them out to people with more than x items
- consider… left hand for transactions at drive thrus
- keep tall piles of baskets because no one likes to bend
- many baskets are stupid… they are difficult to carry when heavy. 
    - nylon bags are better for some things. Can also sell
    - one place redesigned their bags every season. It was a walking billboard and people would go just for the bags!
- coat check/will call system: people leave their coats, then point out what they want, and pick everything up when they leave. Handsfree system
    - important because people need to touch stuff to be more likely to buy
    - flat tables often better than racks for clothes, easier to touch
    - good esp for souvenir shops--no one wants to lug their stuff on rides, but near the end of the day the store gets crazy because everyone wants souvenirs. However people kept forgetting to pick up
 
SIGNAGE
- think of a store as a giant walk in TV ad
    - info needs to reach customer at right time to suggest where they go and what they might buy, etc
    - really important because most buying decisions are made in the store now
- each zone in the store is different and good for 1 kind of message
- good places for signs: places where you’re waiting for staff (ex. Waiting for shoe size), inside bathroom stalls, escalators
-signs should be where your eye goes--never up in the air and often near face level of other people (ex. Over register at fast food)
- signs on windows/doorways: 2-3 words only (more will not be understood/read)
- upon entering a restaurant--looking only for counter of bathroom. No point of signs on the way to bathroom, but signs facing them while they leave is ok
- fast food: most menu viewing time is done after orders are placed (most just skim for what they’re looking for or already know what they want before the order)
- consider timing. Don’t ad merchandise that is at the back of the store at the cash register line. Don’t ad burgers when people already have orders at the condiment section (dessert would be better)
- in fast food, people often eat alone. Longer messages placed here do get read! Less likely at family places where people are talking.
- longer messages as you get deeper into somewhere
- great: breaking messages into smaller parts, communicating bits a time
- commonalities of banks, fast food, post office: lots of people standing still and facing the same way!
- in task oriented places--people are focused on finishing the task first, and won’t see anything until that’s done
- moving signs tend to get more viewers (but same viewing times)
- understanding how people move…
    - good store layout: good flow, no obstacles/blind spots, all places get visited
    - people slow down when they see reflective surfaces, speed up when they see banks (so don’t be next to a bank)
    - people veer off to the right (sometimes left in some cultures) (ex. Menswear to the right of a department store. Women went in, veered sharply left, and never went back to that side of the store. Childrens was near mens, and hence had low sales.)
- want people to grab something with their hands? Put it to their right.
-planogram: map of which products are where on the shelf
- place to the right of the most popular brand is where you put the brand you’re pushing. They may brush it when they reach out.
- people face and walk forward--but with aisles, we have designed for people who walk sideways!
    - store displays and signs also act as if everyone approaching them is coming from straight on. Usually they come from the side. 
    - in windows, tilt things to the left, because we usually walk as we drive (to the right)
- end caps help sales too, because they are seen so much better (displays at the end of each aisle)
- instead of placing shelves 90 deg to back wall, chevron it so its at 45. This way people see more, but it takes up about 1/5th more floor space. This has been suggested but never tried, because no one is sure if sales will go up because it’s displayed better while only showing 80% of merchandise
- architects need to design with sight lines in mind. If a display can’t be seen clearly from 10-20 feet away, no one will come across it but by accident
- making sure not to block people from seeing other merchandise with other signs or displays. Instead, they should see one thing and be lured, then see another and be lured, and another and be lured, for good flow. Should feel helplessly pulled through the store
- capture rate: how often is it actually seen my shoppers
- defensive walking mechanism: only see certain parts (ex. Above eye level to knee) unless intently looking because otherwise you can’t see where you’re going
    - means a lot of space is wasted/challenge. Better to put big items in those areas
    - should packaging be produced as if we will see everything from sharp angles?
    - ex. Technology which is often stored on floor. Need to put info at the top!
- boomerang rate: how often does a shopper fail to completely walk through the whole aisle?
    - put most popular items at the end of the aisle so they have to go through the whole
    - in kids areas, putting fun floor graphics (ex. Hopscotch down aisle)
- getting people to the back of the store. The conversion rate of dairy is nearly 100%, which is why it’s back there
    - but convenience stores put dairy up front, making it easy to get dairy quickly. Now supermarkets often have a shallow dairy loop so that people without the time can grab and go.
    - still, most don’t put bread and butter of their business on the back wall
    - ex. Teens grabbing soda. Put it near the front, because they only have a short break and don’t want to run in and out.
- also why pharmacy almost always at back. But require signs while they leave, people don’t look while heading to pharmacy
- in apparel, placing sales items at back, and remembering to merchandise from back to front too
- can also put something interesting in back wall, so people slowly head over there. Better than the back feeling like a dead zone
- merchandising front display by time of day and type of customer at that time
- ex. Book store. Mornings: target stay at home mothers with books on child care, family and fitness. Afternoon: target kids with sports, pop music, TV, adolescent stuff. After 5 pm: work crowd, place books on biz and computers. Close the store with books on retirement, finance and travel for the senior citizens who come in for morning exercise before stores are open. 
- how often do customers come? If every 2 weeks, change displays so they always seem fresh and interesting
    - design windows so its easy for employees. Changing will be less of a pain
- remember to check that the locations of specific things are actually being used for its purpose. Ex. washrooms are not so close to the door that at night, hookers are using it.
 
DYNAMIC
- underwear: most women don’t lounge around at home like VS models. Mostly its about what feels good and whether it works with the rest of your clothes. Hence, the more male style underwear came about
- put more chairs! Chairs say we care, people buy from people who care
- anytime you’ve seen shopper improvisation, you have found evidence in the failure to understand what another person requires
    - keep the non shopping party comfortable and contented and off the shoppers back
- for make up: make small, few use testers and sell for a couple bucks!
- we need to understand what people need and design for that. Most spaces aren’t, find out what needs changing
- half of fast food is purchased in the drive thru, expecting that people are leaving elsewhere to eat. Most like to park and eat in their car, where they have their own space. Make sure there are good parking spots for that!
 
MEN
- generally seen to dislike shopping, hence previously designed for women
- but the world is still mostly owned, designed and managed by men… so they don’t get women
- men are genetically disposed to be hunters--kill quick, bring it home
- women are gatherers and lookers: can spend all day shopping without buying and have a good time
- even historically, women were the everyday purchasing agents, and took pride in their ability to shop prudently and well
- men usually move faster through a store, spend less time looking, are less likely to ask any questions (if they can’t find it, they’ll just leave without asking), or look at anything else but what they’re looking for
- also tend to decide to buy faster, once they’ve gotten what they’re looking for
- 65% of guys who try something buy, versus 25% of women (they won’t buy if it doesn’t fit, while for us, even if it does fit, we might not buy)
 - place dressing rooms closer to the guy’s department, and clearly mark it!
86% women look at price tags vs 72% of men. Easier to get the guys to upgrade
- as guys stay single longer, and women are working just as long, they will have to learn to shop too. Good idea to adapt the experience to guys too
- guys are also less disciplined. Almost all women in supermarkets have a list. Fewer than 25% of guys do. They are also more likely to say yes to the kids. (dad as self provider: self-image)
- 60-70% of purchases @ supermarkets are unplanned
- guys may not love shopping, but he gets thrill from paying. Men usually pay if they are with a woman at a grocery store, and prom gown stores depend on this (more exp gown than if with mother)
- guys like to get their info firsthand, ex. At tech stores, going in to read everything instead of ask
    Ex. cell providers. Women: go up and ask about phones and offers. On average require a third visit, and a consultation, before ready to close. Men: walk in, look at displays and grab forms without talking to anyone. When they return, it is to sign up.
- men still make more decisions for cars, and buy for what goes outside the house, while women buy for inside
- put historic roles of men and women and the idea of the nuclear family into perspective…
    - most households are non-traditional. A house built for that will sell faster and better.
- women spend less time in stores if she is with a man… followed by by herself (efficient alone), with kids (need to take care of them), with a female friend (they can talk, advice, etc)
    - having the guy around makes it easier to sell big ticket items
    - occupy the man so the female shopper can be happier and more relaxed, spend more time and money… (TV/magazines with male interests, open women oriented stores next to a male oriented stores and vice versa), sell to men (for when they are buying gifts) (but where to put these areas? Needs to be easy for men to see, but don’t want window shoppers to look in and see a bunch of guys)
    - get the guy involved: include a section for them, and put up charts for their reading (ex. The glass place, doing a beverage related section with all kinds of gear, the furniture store showing graphics about the construction of furniture, gives them something to do and offset cost of new furniture) **do that for clothing? Show the process?
- guys always outbuy women in beer and junk/entertainment food
    - cater the beer to the girls. They tend to buy more for the family, guys buy for 1
- for roles that guys are now picking up, need to appeal to them without alienating the women (and vice versa, ex. More female friendly home hardware stores)
- advertising home appliances to men: gotten more butch, advertise power, sound more manly… ex. Soap called Lever 2000
- women used to buy clothing for the men too--guys are finally buying more of their own clothes
- many men buying lingerie/jewelry for women are buying their way back into the house… but it is terrifying for them to choose something at the store. Need to find ways to deal with that before they run away (what colour does she like, clothing size)
- how to show obvious split in stores with both male/female clothing? Where does the homosexual fit? Women can take mens clothing without a problem, not the other way around.
- gays tend to follow the trends, so the rest follow… but secretly, don’t want to admit they care while still look as good
- consider the gay market…
- many more guys are caring for kids now--there is a lot of space that won’t fit a pram!
    - baby changing areas in guy washrooms
    - make it less confusing for guys to shop kids clothing, who will prob spend more
- making kids stuff less feminine--studly harley baby strollers, built in black leather diaper bag
- there are a lot of stores where everything feels too feminine, makes men feel like they need to leave
- places where men would want or even need to shop, like beauty/health/grooming directed to men, but the way they are sold, hard to get male buyers
    - even if not packaged in a feminine way, but in aisles of feminine goods
    - moisturizing creams and sunblock for guys: would need to be marketed differently. Fuss-free, with a manly name
    - wall charts for skin types
    -create an entire men’s health department
 
WOMEN
- shopping still mostly by women
- @ supermarkets: much more likely to ‘research’ through everything before choosing some (ex. All the meats for one packet, bunch of broccoli before grabbing one)
- as women work more and have less time, faster grocery shopping markets were created, and may have become more masculine in the grab and go behaviour
- 2 women together always end up spending more time and money
- women care that they do well in even the smallest act of purchasing and tape pride in being able to select the perfect thing
- men only do the above with certain durable goods like cars, tools, computers, etc
- guys just need a place to get their stuff and leave. Women need a place to wander and seek
- esp hate bending over to look at something because of butt brush effect--and esp if they are possibly guys behind her
    - can brave personal bubble breaches for big sales though
- cosmetics in department stores: creating a catchment basin (recessed area) where women are safe from foot traffic.
- place grab and buy things near the register, place items that need consideration farther away in ‘protected’ areas
- women like to study products before buying, especially if its new. The more reading, the more buying. Create space for them to do so.
- other ways males and females have diff spatial requirements:
    - fast food: men: easily choose a table up front. Women: look around for a place, prob in back with some privacy. Also less likely to eat there alone, will go thru drive thru and eat in car.
    - cards: a lot of time spent looking at each one. Emotional, warm feeling, needs to be quiet. Won’t buy without looking at a lot
        (should get a diff display system. Cards are fragile)
-making hardware women friendly--making it from just tools to women strength and ability, hiring female staff, females in ads, and selling homes/lifestyle (including curtains and jacuzzis and kitchen stuff and everything else)
      - past: go to hardware when you need something. Now, you can actually see whats new and on display (hence shop hardware)
- tech stores: seems like a guy thing, but females were some of the earliest adopters
    Guys are in love with the technology itself
Women are interested in what it does, how it makes life easier
Given that women do the most shopping, tech stores would be better off if they also marketed towards women, about how the tech will make their life better, and hiring more female help, and using females in ads
@ 1 store, primarily male customers, but females with highest conversion rates
- same with car dealerships: get female sales, female service, market to them… when they’re in guyland, they feel patronized, scorned and ripped off
 
DESIGNING FOR A POPULATION THAT’S GETTING OLDER
- esp important for reading important products that seniors buy most (ex. Drugs, health, beauty related where people like to read about it before buying)
- 2025 anything > 13 pt font = suicide
- aside from worse vision, it also gets dimmer and yellower/colours fade into each other. Use bold, high contrast print and better lighting
- older customers have more disposable income! Shouldn’t we be tailoring our stores to them?
    -but we don’t: high end designers leave larger sizes in the back. Sometimes larger sizes on shelves are placed at the bottom.
- cater to the older customer, young people can get to what they want
- in supermarkets, anything too high or low is basically off limits to seniors
- in too large retailers/shopping areas, rest areas are a must for tired seniors. It will keep people there longer, be a better experience, and is a good area for conveying messages
    -remembering to use chairs that are easy to get in and out of
- heavy products should be at a height that’s easy to move to carts
- hands start to hurt--need bigger buttons, easier clothing closures
- can be intimidated for seniors to learn new technology, but if they have someone their age teaching them, it’s more comforting
- seniors and fashion
    - they also want to look good, with smth that fits and is comfy
    - but no one wants what is targeted towards seniors…
    - many dont work anymore so better off with sneakers, athletics…
    - but with sneakers, think of ones that are “hip” and targeted to younger
 
KIDS
- if a store is unwelcome to children (ex. too small for pram), will lose female customers atleast for parts of their lives
- important to child proof the place, and put things meant for kids low (near ground if kids walk, near height of shopping cart if they are in carts!
- at places where parents need to focus, provide things to distract the kids
- kids love to touch stuff, and will touch everything they can reach
- kid friendly restaurants
- kids clothing sizes and reading levels should be made more clear for people wanting to buy other kids presents
- books: place the fun, child oriented ones low for kids to grab, and more serious sounding, academic titles up top for parents to grab for their kids
- DVDs: separate by gender topics, put kids low near where the women go.
- store with too much kid appeal: annoyed parents may stop coming!
 
THE SENSES
- almost all unplanned buying is a result of touching, hearing, smelling or tasting something on the premises of a store
- hence merchandising is more powerful than marketing, and why internet, catalogs and home shopping will prosper and complement, but never seriously challenge real live stores
Shoppers love...
- mirrors. Stores usually fail to provide enough of them around wearable items
- discovery: stores shouldn’t be confusing, but they should be seductive… sometimes too many signs can make it too easy
- talking: stores that attracts couples/friends/groups usually do well. Foster discussion and talking and the merchandise begins to sell itself
- recognition: people want to shop where they feel wanted--here small stores can have an advantage
- bargains: not necessarily simply cutting prices (ex. 5 pairs for 20 sounds better than 1 for $5), but they won’t like it if it gets too crazy at the discount table
Shoppers hate…
Too many mirrors. Gets disorienting after a while.
Lines. Even a good shopping trip gets wiped out by a bad experience in a line. (frustration at watching inefficiency, anxiety about which line is faster, boredom)
Asking dumb questions. Make it obvious information available and not behind glass doors.
dipping/bending
Goods out of stock
Obscure price tags
Intimidating service, or shit service in general, no matter how good your merchandise is. Shopping may be a practical activity, and feelings always come first
 
THE SENSUAL SHOPPER
- think of shopping as getting to see what is for sale and whether we want to buy it or not
- we usually buy with trial and touch
    - shame that mens underwear is all in packages and can’t be touched
    - even things like lightbulbs, which don’t get touched, can be seen in action to sell better
- we want to investigate products that offer possibilities or invite comparison, ex new ketchup or new beer, never things like sugar, veg oil, milk
- 90% of new grocery products fail because people never tried them!
    - even cigarettes originally started with a method of handing out samples from attractive people
- but know who to gear sampling/marketing towards
    - ex. General mills popcorn. Mostly purchased by women, but what they needed to do was reach out to men (it’s an easy to make snack food). 
- beyond food, involvement drops. No one cares about a better food wrap, foil, or trash bag
- smell is important too--note the coffee, bakery smells in supermarkets… make people hungry
    - best buy: smell of fresh linen in appliance section, etc
- touch is particularly important now because brand names are no longer as powerful. Despite all the marketing, buyers want to see/smell/touch/hear/taste/try it first before believing
    - even if soft drinks are fridged unseen, people won’t buy because they’re not sure it will be cold
- a lot of info comes to us from shopping--look at kids and dogs touching everything! They are shopping.
    - even things without much smell, touch, sensual experience… like books, get touched and experienced a lot
- change of ownership happens when the shoppers senses latch onto the object
    - paying is a mere technicality--and the least pleasurable part of it all
- hence stores should be begging for shoppers to touch and try, instead of making it as difficult as possible. Without being allowed to try, we can only ever buy the brand we always bought, the one on sale, or a recommended brand…
- even appliances… we want to know things like how loud it is. That can be a big part of how we choose which one to buy
- bed linens. Why package it like that? No one knows what thread count is, if it hasn’t been washed to remove sizing then it feels its worst. All we really care is how it feels.
- dressing rooms: most are tiny and so dismal, so uncomfortable. need space and great lighting to help the person look their best
    - they shouldn’t be far away, and need to be easy to find!
- if you have to look for a mirror, you’re likely to decide its not worth the trouble
- anticipate what shoppers will do
    - ex. If you have diff kinds of sharpeners out, have stuff like pencils there for them to try, and if its electrical, have it already plugged in. otherwise how is it a serious attempt to sell?
    - if you have several kinds of paper, you NEED paper samples. People end up tearing packages to see. Don’t be cheap, it’ll bite you
- making merchandise inaccessible in any way will hurt.
- capitalizing on this: ex. Selling phones. People like to hold it up to their ear. Make it play or say something, and they’ll hold it to other people’s ears, get them talking, always a good thing.
- best way to limit package destruction: offer shoppers a way to try without doing any damage. Shopper unfriendly packaging discourages buying and encourages damage.
- a store that allows access to merchandise is doing it’s own marketing, and is less dependent on the labels. It is also more fun, and encourage more shopping!
- advent of shrink wrap has made access worse too
- even if security is a problem, you can usually find a middle ground
    - ex. Clothing. Place darker colours where touching occurs, and lighter colours high up/near bottom.
- also make the experience of trying so that you can also try it with accessories (often the largest margins), and selling up (comparing and spending more)
- displays that look like they’ve taken a lot of hard work to assemble (or just too neat) scare customers away from touching
 
THE BIG THREE
- Design (the premises), merchandising (whatever you put in them), operations (whatever employees do)
- these 3 are interrelated and interdependent!! Change one, everything changes
- must research all the farthest reaching implications before changing design of anything
- these days corporations are always trying to cut labour. Previously when stores were properly staffed, demands on design and merchandising were lower because clerks were available and helpful
    - Now sales are underpaid and valued, burden falls on design and merchandising
 
TIME
- above 90 seconds, peoples inner clocks perceive it as longer
- waiting in a drive through feels faster, because it’s your own car with music heat etc
- time spent waiting after an employee has initiated contact feels faster than waiting for the interaction to take place
- also helps to tell them how long a wait will be, even if its not accurate
- orderliness helps too (ex. People are being helped in the order they arrived) aka get rid of uncertainty
- best is one single line, but a long line looks bad, so 5 lines of 5 feels better than 1 of 25
- may be better not to put cashiers in view of the outside--if people see it’s busy, they leave
    - Best Buy: enters you through a maze with high shelving, can’t see how busy it is
    - whole foods: series of mini lines with TVs showing which number you should go to. Breaking up a larger line
- having someone to talk to helps, lone waiters are the ones who need contact most
- diversion: short entertainment, samples, positioning racks of impulse items (position for second in line and back) and magazines
- waiting lines are great for signage
- other types of waiting: walking around looking for someone for help
 
CASH/WRAP
- in small shops, can be run by 1 person if cash/wrap @ front. If @ rear, need security.
- but seeing it first kind of promises misery
-when pondering location, must envision it full of people, not empty
- often line ups are like human barricades, blocking people from seeing or getting places
- separate repairs and returns from people buying. Putting them together is not good
- give gift wrap a separate section
- why is checking in at hotels so painful? People are tired and jet lagged!
    - should do everything else in advance, so just get key on arrival
    - provide chairs, you sit and a clerk will come with everything needed
 
ADD ON SALES
- No new customers, enough stores--get more visits, more time in store, more and bigger purchases
- in a bar, proceeds from jukebox, cig machine and coin vid games covered the rent. Diff between getting by and prospering
- ex. Book store doesn’t just sell books. Selling to people who like books
- put the whole package together near each other. Ex. tacho shells with ground meat. Ties and shirts and shoes with the tux. Sample size shampoos near reg size--how else can we try?
- also consider order--chips at the end of the line, gift wrap after the shoppers already have the gifts
- boring to look at hundreds of dressers next to each other. Having it displayed with other items, you can imagine it in a home, how it might be used…. Etc
- good adjacencies: stand near something and think, what is being cross sold here?
- people like to compare by item, and if it’s inexpensive, then by other characteristics
- need to think about the deployment of merchandising materials, how it will look wen half the merchandise is gone
- activated endcaps get noticed more, but several activated endcaps cancel each other out
- really need to see how ideas end up on the floor and incertain situations to see how it will do
- making displays to categorize things like spices is useless--customers care more about what it does to food, how it tastes/smells, etc
 
INTERNET
- too much unfiltered information, unsure of the source
- feel like if something can’t be found online, it doesn’t exist (ex. All out of seats on a certain flight)
- too many choices--need someone to decrease the range. Overwhelmed consumers respond
- best of lists are so popular (usually just most popular, not necessarily a list with any thought, or the best)
- popular items have been pre-vetted by others
- public forums, reviews
- can be hard to get customer service from automated places like Amazon
- global vs local: optimizing search engine by the person and where they’re located (ex. Clothing is diff in Texas and NYC)
- online shopping
    - pre-shop: data gathering, surfing, getting to know products. May save time when going in to grab later, or if too lazy, order online
    - secondary shopping therapy: no crowds, lines, scary clerks, can look everywhere
    - time savings (ex. Avoid malls at xmas time)
- secondary second hand markets
- usually sales happens when you know something already and the size, easily check out
    - also kids online communities
    - surprisingly, also art
    - his friend: finds cool stuff in small quantities, gets featured in mags, sells on his website
