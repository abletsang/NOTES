Visualize the customer’s life. See from the customer’s perspective. Go to their conferences, go to their meetings, read their magazines, etc. Write down the wants and needs of your customer and order them by priority.
 
Use index cards to write all the benefits and of every objection, suspicion or excuse they may have
When writing, you can play around with these index cards to decide how to organizee verything
 
Openly address the disadvantages. Your credibility will go up.
Order of sale: AIDA: attention, interest, desire, action
 
From unwanted pest to welcome guest—say something of importance and of value. Do it in the headline.

To mass market:
Apperance: bright, different coloured pieces, vivid photography, things to get involved with the lette (ex. In mail there are stickers, tokens, etc)
 
To executives/business owners: awesome quality paper/envelopes, place order forms and other pieces in 2nd envelope inside the main one, use big professional words…
 
To professional services: use descriptive items of fact (# of yrs in business, # of clients served, sample client lists, etc)
 
Other tips: free consultation, package, info, etc. Demonstrate the value. Make the intangible benefits of your product tangible.
 
Guidelines for immediate sales:
            Testimonials from happy users. Biggest thing to increase sales.
            Photographs outperform drawings and illustrations. [check photographs vs video]
            Prove that it’s easy to use
 
Pricing
Compare apples to oranges to confuse the price issue. Ex. Instead of comparing cassettes to cassettes, compare cassettes to going to the seminar on the cassette
Bulking: turn benefits and value into a big number. Ex. Instead of an apple a day keeps an apple way, list every freaking vitamin and mineral in it.
Discuss the price paid to develop the offer
Make the parts worth more than the whole
Conceal the price: break into smaller amounts for x months
 
3 letter formulas to overcome hesitation over price (can be combined together): get reader to focus on something other than how much money he’s going to spend
1. problem-agitation-solution
Present the problem no clear, straightforward terms, and say only enough to elicit agreement (if problem is complex: may need to add much more detail and proof)
Inject emotion: tap into their anger, resentment, guilt, embarrassment, fear, etc. make the problem as bad as possible, until they are angry and decide they need a solution, and that’s when…
2. fortune telling
Our fascination with those who predict the future never ends… the 2 keys to unlimited media attention and publicity are being predictive and provocative
What lies ahead in your industry? For your customers? How can I help them prepare for the future? Help them protect against a danger? An opportunity to exploit? New exciting trend?
Bring the future to the present and fascinate your readers
3. winners and losers
            One did this, the other did that. What made the difference?
            The 5% and 95%.
Create fear of being in the 95%, and motivation to be in the 5%
 
Sales Letter Techniques
1. Intimidation: the desperate deals are the hardest to make. By ‘taking a position’ and seeming like you don’t need them, that’s how stuff sells.
Ways to take a position
Limited # available
Most will buy (bandwagon effect… everyone is getting involved and anyone who passes this by is dumb)
You will buy only if… [challenge their pride or ego]
Only can buy only if… [listen to intro material, answer this, qualify, etc]
Only some can qualify… [appeal to desire to be part of an elite group for approval and recognition]
Strong credibility copy [intimidate away doubts and fears with super strong explanation of credibility]
 
2. Demonstrate ROI
Puts you into a position of selling money at a discount
Talk about, promise, and if possible, demonstrate this
Can be presented in dollars to be made/saved
Sometimes pays to exaggerate, then bring back down (even if I’m only half right, you’ll still…)
 
3. Ego Appeals
Anything portrayed as a status symbol
 
4. Strong Guarantee
Done in the following ways…
Basic money-back (spruce up with the wording)
Refund and keep the premium (free bonus gift)
Redundancy (say it a couple times!)
Free trial offer
Make the guarantee the primary focus of the offer (start with the guarantee. Might not be money—also time, fares, etc)
Very strong method: guarantee the letter’s value by offering to pay them if the reader decides it’s not (or donate more to a charity
 
The draft: just write, don’t worry about anything. Get every possible persuasive idea onto paper. Edit and cut out things later.
 
Who is going to read all that copy?
Those people most likely to respond.
Aka write for the buyer, not the non-buyer.
Real prospects are hungry for information.
Extensive text ads are actually read more thoroughly than shorter (50 words~)
Read more like we talk than how we’re supposed to write. Use conversational English, slang, short choppy sentences, odd punctuation and phrasing, nonsentences, one world exclamations, buzzwords, etc to push and pull the reader along, create momentum and excitement. Enthusiasm is infectious
 
Double readership path:
For the analytical: the entire long sales copy
For the impulsive: headlines, pictures, bolded sentences help them skim and must give a full picture, so that they can either buy right away or consider the full length copy
 
2 ways we accept new ideas and info as valid: repetition or by shock
Internal repetition: tell them, then tell them a lil diff, then again a lil diff, then again, then tell them what you told em. Try for 7x
In the same sales letter, you can convey your basic sales message and promise: in a straightforward statement, in an example, in a story (aka “slice of life”), in testimonials, in a quote (from customer, expert, or spokesperson), in a numbered summary)
 
Yes sequence: build a momentum and habit of the reader agreeing, starting with things they can easily agree with and building it. Can start or end paragraphs with question, or using them as subheads, ask questions that involve the reader
 
Tease the reader at the end of each page: never end a page with a completed sentence. It’s like permission to stop. Do it mid-sentence, pref something exciting.
 
Teaser copy: to get someone to flip, tease them with the information that they can find on the next page (another headline really… to get them to keep reading)
 
Increasing readability: appears easy to read, easy on the eye, uses everyday language/easy to understand (especially short punchy sentences)
Short paragraphs (ideally 3-4 sentences max)
Use your first paragraph as an extended headline. This is the paragraph that sells the recipient to read the letter, the rest is for your proposition
Be entertaining, not funny or dead-serious. Make it fun to read, don’t bore the reader.
Stimulate mind with all 5 senses so that they visualize pictures and feel experiences
If you are stuck on writing passages that evoke that kind of visualization and feeling and sound like they are from a novel, can just try putting in bursts of color and vivid description here and there
Show some personality… make it sound like it’s coming from a real human... sell in print as you would in person
 
Advantages in selling in person
responding only to the objections mentioned
immediate feedback
“box in” the customer
 
Boxing in the customer: aka draining the objections. List all the objections on a pad before answering them. Keep asking “anything else?” and then ask, “if we can take care of all these concerns to your satisfaction—and I’m not sure that we can—but if we can, you will want to go ahead with the XYS tonight, right?” if they agree, they are boxed in!
 
Letters can’t do that. They have to respond to every objection, and it must be more than enough.
Never overestimate a customer’s intelligence, but never underestimate skepticism
 
2 ways to address objections
1. FAQ
2. as attractive as …. Is, our marketing experts tell us only x% will respond. From a business standpoint, it’s fine, but personally, it bothers me. You see, I know… (launch into what customers say).. hate the thought of people not getting my stuff because of some error or omission in our explanation. That’s why I had a special brainstorming session with a group of our people to figure out why you might say no to our free trial offer. After several hours, we could only think of… and they are…
 
Answers to most objections should include…
A direct answer
A verifying testimonial comment, case history, or story
A restatement of or reference to the guarantee/free trial offer
 
Get the reader to respond IMMEDIATELY… with these 7 ways
limited availability
premiums (over discount or rebate). Requires that the company is trusted, the product is liked, the premium is exciting and desirable, and the urgency building story is believed
deadline (especially when combined with other methods)
multiple premiums (for diff amount orders)
discounts for fast response, penalties for slow response
sweepstakes and contests (with entry deadlines)
ease of responding
 
must have a P.S. as many readers skip to the end
a proper summary of the offer/promise can inspire a recipient to dig in and an extra incentive to respond
 
to help make a long sales letter look like an easier and fast read, use… (for voice inflection, not appearance)
bullets
numbering
underlining
bolding
varied font
font that looks like handwriting (in the margins, in the PS)
boxes
lines made of asterisk ******
yellow overprint (to look like real highlighter)
screens (washes of light dot pattern over text)
photographs with type running around them
subheads.. lots of them
 
again, people buy with emotion—logical, “cold fish” doesn’t work. What will seem overly expressive when you write it will still wind up understated when it’s read. Must be enthusiastic.
Be passionate, exciting, almost wild. Be different! Stand out! Make a stink if it’s like what everyone else is doing.
 
Edit for clarity: say as much as you can as clearly as you can in as little words as you can
 
Compare your drafts with other letters to isolate your word’s strengths and weaknesses. Is it smooth? Compelling? Speak to the target audience? Easy to understand? Excite the reader to action?
 
Pretesting your copy
read the letter aloud. Should flow silently and aloud. Fix tongue twisters
read the letter to several people who might be typical customers for the offer… if they start asking how they can get it, it’s sound. If they want to buy, then it’s a winner. If people have questions, they need to be addressed.
have a young child read it aloud to you: if they have difficulty reading any part of it, it should probably be changed
 
the design of graphics should be appealing as well
 
OTHER SALES COPY NOTES
 
More hidden elements of copy
Repetition of single words
Embedded commands (subtlety including words that say what you would like the reader to do)
Emotion (buy with emotion, justify with logic). Make them feel good.
Phrases with similes, metaphors, etc that creates an imagine, emotion, feeling… “jumping off the page” “pull your readers in like a magnet”… often not just to buy but to read on, for them to motivate themselves to find out more
 
3 types of readers.
Skimmers – These people will skim a page up and down quickly, just to get a quick overview of what you’re selling. They’re typically pretty quick to act and already have their minds made up before they even get to the page.
Jumpers – These people spend more time on the page than skimmers, but less than readers. They will skim the page, but then if something catches their attention – they’ll dive into the copy and read it thoroughly.
Book Worms – These people read the whole damn thing, top to bottom…. every single word. They’re typically slower decision makers and tend to think things over and want every single ounce of detail before making a decision. Or sometimes – they just like to read :)
What you want to do for long-form sales-letters is make is so that someone can literally read the headline, and the subheads… and have the minimum information they need to make a buying decision.
The best thing a person can do is turn skimmers, into jumpers… and jumpers… into book worms. That’s why it’s important to have fun, exciting, engaging copy.
If you look at this example selling an “inversion table” you’ll see that I layout the entire offer right inside the order box. This is for the people who want to get straight to the offer to see what it is. Instead of simply saying “you get an inversion table for $299”… I list out ALL the features, the benefits, an image, as well as everything else in the offer.
The best technique you can ever use in copy is simply understanding the dominant emotions going on inside your prospects mind at the exact moment he/she is reading your copy. It helps you understand how to phrase things, what kind of offer to give them, what to price your products at, what benefits to hit on, how aggressive or subtle the copy should be… and literally everything else you need to know.
